**Dayani Rocha – Building Strong Foundations in Engineering & Software Development**

Welcome.
This repository reflects my development journey as I build a solid foundation in Computer Engineering, software development, systems, and applied problem-solving.

My current focus is on consistent study, technical depth, and disciplined practice — aiming to grow into a developer capable of designing, implementing, and maintaining solutions that are clean, reliable, and grounded in engineering principles.

**About Me**

I am a Computer Engineering student with a structured, long-term approach to learning.
My routine is currently centered on:

Strengthening my fundamentals in programming, algorithms, computer architecture, and operating systems.

Applying concepts through small but purposeful projects.

Practicing clean Git workflows to build professional habits from day one.

Studying consistently with a weekly schedule covering multiple subjects.

Prioritizing clarity, logic, and long-term understanding instead of shortcuts.

My goal is simple: to become a developer who understands why things work — not only how to code them.

**Technical Skills (Growing & Consolidating)**

-Python, C, and JavaScript (progressive practice)

-Data structures, algorithms, computational thinking

-Git & GitHub (branches, commits, versioning discipline)

-CLI & shell scripting basics

-Foundations of networks, systems, hardware, and software architecture

**Complementary Focus Areas:**

Backend logic and architecture

Documentation and technical writing

Automation and practical tooling

Introduction to AI models and applied usage

Testing mindset and debugging practices

**Current Study Focus (Q1–Q2)**
My current learning cycle includes:

Computer Engineering fundamentals

Python development

Algorithms & problem-solving training

Networks, OS concepts, and system structure

Git/GitHub version control mastery

Mathematical foundations relevant to computing

I follow a structured weekly study plan with dedicated review days to reinforce long-term retention and real competence.
